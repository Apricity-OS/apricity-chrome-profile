    <h1>Important!</h1>
    <h2>The Great Suspender has been updated</h2>

    <hr class="splashRule" />

    <h2><strong>The bad news:</strong></h2>
    <p>In order to perform this update, all your suspended tabs have been removed from your browser. Due to the way The Great Suspender used to work, there was no way to prevent this from happening or from letting you know in advance.</p>

    <p><strong>BUT</strong>, if you go to the new <a href='/history.html' target='_blank'>session management</a> page, you will find your recently suspended tabs in the 'Recent sessions' section. From here you should be able to recover any lost tabs. If this does not go back far enough in time, then under 'Saved sessions' you will find a more comprehensive list of previously suspended tabs.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, this will never happen again. Future updates of this extension will not have this same issue - your tabs will be remembered and will be restored automagically.</p>

    <p>If losing your tabs has made you extremely upset and you want to uninstall this extension: fair enough - but before you do, please go through the session recovery process first and make sure all your tabs are recovered and unsuspended before you uninstall.</p>

    <h2><strong>The good news:</strong></h2>
    <p>This new version contains lots of bug fixes and new features such as session management, temporary whitelisting, form input detection and cross device history support. You can check it all out in the <a href='/options.html' target='_blank'>settings</a> page.</p>

    <p>Thanks for using <strong>The Great Suspender!</strong></p>
